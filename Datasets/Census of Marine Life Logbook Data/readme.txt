Formats

This download package includes two versions of each of the four datasets, one in Excel xlsx format and one as tab-delimited text. The tab-delimited text file has column names in the first row. It is UTF-8 encoded with Unix line endings between records and no line breaks embedded within any data. The content of the two versions is identical.


Additions & corrections

Users who have facts to add or who discover errors in the database are encouraged to submit them. We plan to update the online database annually. https://whalinghistory.org/participate/corrections/
