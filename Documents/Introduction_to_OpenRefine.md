## Introduction to OpenRefine

Our tool of choice for [Day 1](../Schedule.md) will be **OpenRefine**. From their [website](https://openrefine.org/): 

>OpenRefine is a powerful free, open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; and extending it with web services and external data.

- [Download and install OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/download)

In short:

- Excel that doesnâ€™t suck
- able to manipulate huge datasets
- non-destructive: it stores the data alongside a history of all changes and makes them reversible
- well documented: check out the [User Manual](https://openrefine.org/docs)
- extensive support for import and export formats
