## 1. Understanding the Dataset
- Whaling Crew List Database from the New Bedford Whaling Museum[^1]
- Importance of context, provenance, production
- Data model and categories
- Notes regarding columns:

    Column | Description
    -------|------------
    | Rig  | Configuration of the rigging (system of ropes, cables, and chains + masts and sails), can be proxy for size and capabilities of vessel.
    |Lay  |  For a given voyage, each man receives a lay or percentage of the profits, instead of wages. The size of the lay depends upon his rank and speciality: the captain always earns the largest share, usually around 1/8th, while a green hand (inexperienced crewman) earns the least, often as little as 1/350th. 
    Rank | Includes both officers and crew, in descending order: Captain, officers (usually three or four mates, each commanding a whaleboat), boatsteerers (these are the harpooneers), specialists (blacksmith, carpenter, cook, cooper–i.e. caskmaker–, and steward), foremast hands (ordinary crewmen).

## 2. Introducing OpenRefine
- Excel that doesn’t suck
- can manipulate much bigger datasets
- non-destructive: [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org) project stores not just data, but history of changes
- well [documented](https://openrefine.org/docs)
- extensive support for import and export formats
- besides advanced manipulation tools it supports basic but very useful visualization (and filtering) through facets
